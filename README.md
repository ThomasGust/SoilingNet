# SoilingNet
This repository is for the SoilingNet Project. Soiling Net is an AI model to analyze soiling and power loss on photovoltaic panels, with the ultimate goal of making solar panel maintenance easier for everyone.

We also introduced a subset of the DeepSolarEye dataset with hand labeled semantic segmentation masks for this project.
